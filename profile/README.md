## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the organization for the course **applied statistics** _MATH-516_.

### Projects
For each of your project, please create a repository specific to it (e.g. `team_1_project_1`) and set its visibility to your team only. Remember to add `dufourc1` to your team so that I can see the repository.
